                        Overview and HistoryDo you know why you never like to
                        get out of the bathtub? It's because you wish you were
                        in Venice, that's why.Take one hundred and eighteen
                        salt-marsh islands in the northern Adriatic. Combine
                        them with Roman refugees and a liberal stinking of
                        Visigoth invaders. Shake until well-mixed. Season with
                        Crusaders, international silk trading and seamen of
                        naval warfare. Glaze thickly with castrated Baroque
                        sopranos and finish with a garnish of bridges. Serve on
                        boats.Venice is divided into six districts called
                        "Sistieri" in Italian; that word will come in handy when
                        you're floating hither and yon. They are Cannaregio, San
                        Polo, Dorsoduro, Santa Croce, San Marco, and
                        Castello.Beyond these, there's Lido and Mestre. Lido is
                        a sandbar to the east of Venice with 20,000 permanent
                        residents and 65 tranzillion summer people. In the
                        beginning of the 12th century, thousands of Crusaders
                        were stuck here in Lido when they could not afford to
                        pay transport rates for Venetian ships! See, location
                        really IS everything.On the west side of the Lagoon is
                        Mestre, which has the airport, the buses, the traffic
                        and basically everything else from modern life that you
                        come to Venice to ignore. To be fair, for centuries now
                        Mestre has borne the brunt of the international shipping
                        traffic coming into Porto Marghera, while "Venice" takes
                        all the credit. Typical older sibling.How did it get
                        here? Venice used its location at the top of the
                        Adriatic to become a massive naval and commercial power.
                        By the end of the thirteenth century, trading among the
                        Byzantine Empire and the Muslim countries to the south
                        had made Venice the wealthiest city in Europe.Venice
                        declined in stature from the 15th century. First they
                        lost a war against the Ottoman Empire and then lost a
                        lot of business when a sea route to India bypassed their
                        port. The Plague came in next and wiped out a third of
                        the citizensBut nevermind that! Venice was the center of
                        the musical universe during Opera season. Composers,
                        musicians and mask makers would prepare all year for the
                        orgy of productions that came to Venice during
                        Carnival.Real quick -- opera was an Italian invention
                        for combining Greek tragedies with music, theater and
                        spectacle. It broke out of private royal courts and
                        became a public event as of 1637, supported by a season
                        of ticket sales before Lent. Hence opera season.Pow,
                        zing, wow and instant popularity. Masks were permitted
                        to be worn in public, European dignitaries arrived from
                        everywhere, and this was THE PLACE to be. I mean, like,
                        imagine Louis XIV getting up on stage to prance while
                        the orchestra freaks out and plays the ritornello a few
                        more times until he wants to sit down again. (Orchestras
                        don't really improvise so well).Ever been to the movies?
                        Thank Venice. In fact, to this day a vestige of the
                        operatic tradition remains -- Lido hosts the Venice Film
                        Festival in September of every year. Hint hint, late
                        summer visit, hint hint.Getting ThereVenice is served by
                        the The Marco Polo Airport. Here's an overview of where
                        the airport is in relation to the city.Now it's time to
                        look at that map and start cheering because you can take
                        a BOAT to and from the airport!! Traffic jams do not
                        exist on boats. Maybe some kind of docking delay once in
                        a while, but who's going to complain about that?Thus
                        Venice is yours for the taking (plus ten Euros to the
                        boat operator).The airport is also connected to the city
                        by buses, which regularly run to railway stations
                        Venice-Santa Lucia and Mestre-Venice.You can buy bus
                        tickets at the local tobacco shop or news
                        stand.TransportationPublic transportation in Venice
                        transcends all other people-moving devices on earth.
                        This is how city life should be, enjoyable and relaxed
                        during every instant of the day or night.Where on earth
                        is the metro a primary reason for visiting? Nowhere.
                        Usually it's the primary reason for LEAVING. Let me wipe
                        the sweat of ugly metro-memories from my brow before we
                        go on to this placid paradise.Buses cross the Lagoon

                        and cheap water buses that connect the canals of the
                        city to the different islands and the lagoon. The Grand
